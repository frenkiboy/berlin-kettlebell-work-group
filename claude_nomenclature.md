# Kettlebell Juggling: Complete Taxonomy & Progression System

## Existing Systems in the Field

Three major systematized approaches to kettlebell juggling exist:

**Logan Christopher** (Legendary Strength / kettlebelljuggling.com) created the most formal ranking system with 20 levels and a Master certification. His terminology includes: front flip, reverse flip, uppercut flip, outside flip, helicopter spin, hammer flip, ball clean, hot potato, ball snatch, bottoms-up flip, behind-the-hip flip, overhead flip, under-body flip ("dribbling basketball"), over-the-shoulder flip, and the "Tower of Power" (bottoms-up flip → clean → press → overhead → flip out).

**Jeff Martone** (Tactical Athlete / H2H series) pioneered hand-to-hand (H2H) drills with a crawl-walk-run progression: swing release → tapping drills → hand switches → complex combos. His emphasis is on flowing circuits where drills chain seamlessly.

**Agatsu** (Shawn Mozen) teaches a progression: swing & release → hot potato → bottoms-up toss → basic flips → cross body → hammer spins → helicopter → around-the-body → redirect uppercut → behind the back → forearm stall → pivot catches.

**Cavemantraining** / RAWFIT catalogues elements including: simple flip, simple reverse flip, mug flip, helicopter flip, oblique flip, waiters clean, waiters snatch, pendulum swing, pass-through, and "mills" (pendulum lateral swing into flips).

## Proposed Universal Hierarchy

### Dimension 1: Fundamental Movement Atoms

Every kettlebell juggling move can be decomposed into three phases: **launch**, **airborne manipulation**, and **catch**. This gives us a natural hierarchy:

```

  └── Halo

LEVEL 1: RELEASE & CATCH (no rotation)
  └── Swing release & re-grip (two-hand)
  └── Swing release & re-grip (one-hand, same hand)
  └── Swing release & hand switch (H2H)
  └── Tapping drills (release → tap chest → re-grip)
  └── Hot potato (pass bell body between hands)

LEVEL 2: SINGLE FLIP — TWO HANDS

## Dimension 2: Classification by Physics

Every flip can be described along three independent axes:

| Property | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **Grip at launch** | Handle (overhand, underhand, hammer/vertical) · Ball/bottom · Palm |
| **Rotation axis** | Sagittal (front/back flip) · Transverse (sombrero/helicopter) · Longitudinal (cowboy/beer) |
| **Rotation count** | ½ (half flip) · 1× · 1½ · 2× · 3× |
| **Hand count** | Two-hand · One-hand (same) · One-hand (switch) |
| **Body position** | Front · Side · Behind back · Under leg · Over shoulder · Overhead |
| **Catch type** | Handle · Ball/cannonball · Bottom · Palm · Forearm · Dragon |

This gives us a **combinatorial space** — and your personal naming convention maps onto it cleanly:

| Your Name | Grip | Axis | Rotation | Body Position |
|-----------|------|------|----------|---------------|
| Front | Handle (horiz.) | Sagittal ↑ | 1× | Front |
| Back | Handle (horiz.) | Sagittal ↓ | 1× | Front |
| Sombrero | Handle (horiz.) | Transverse | 1× | Front/Side |
| Cowboy | Handle (vert.) | Sagittal | 1× | Front |
| Beer | Handle (vert.) | Transverse | 1× | Front |
| Palm spin | Palm | Transverse | 1× | Front |
| Helicopter | Handle | Transverse | 1×+ | Front |
| Spiderman | Palm (up) | Sagittal ↑ | 1× | Below |

## Moves Found in Other Systems But Missing From Your List

### Definitely missing

| Move | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Swing release & re-grip** | All systems | The true Level 0 — release at top of swing, re-catch without any rotation. Foundation for everything. |
| **Tapping drills** | Jeff Martone H2H | Release → tap chest/thighs/clap → re-grip. Builds hand speed. |
| **Hot potato** | Logan C, Agatsu | Pass the bell body between hands rapidly (no flip). Appears in your "ball clean" combos but not named. |
| **Uppercut flip** | Logan C (Level 2) | Quick upward flip at hip level, very close to body. Distinct from standard front flip. |
| **Helicopter spin** | Logan C, Agatsu, Cavemantraining | Horizontal 360° spin — your "sombrero" covers single flips but the continuous helicopter spin (multiple rotations, same axis) is not listed. |
| **Hammer flip / reverse hammer** | Logan C (Level 4) | Flip from a vertical/hammer grip — related to your "cowboy" but specifically the hammer grip initiation. |
| **Ball clean** | Logan C, Cavemantraining | Catch the ball (not handle) in a clean motion. Foundation for many combos. |
| **Ball snatch** | Logan C (Level 7, 11, 16) | Single-arm snatch catching by the ball, overhead. |
| **Ball thruster launch** | Logan C (Level 7) | Squat → explosive ball-grip launch → hot potato. |
| **Forearm stall** | Agatsu | KB rests balanced on forearm — a hold/catch that chains into flips. |
| **Forearm stall with flip** | Agatsu | Stall → flip out of the forearm stall. |
| **Bottoms-up toss** | Agatsu | Toss KB from bottoms-up position. |
| **Bottoms-up clean → flip out** | Logan C (Level 8) | Flip into BU rack, then flip out. |
| **Bottoms-up snatch → flip out** (Tower of Terror) | Logan C (Level 17) | BU snatch to overhead, flip out. |
| **Tower of Power** | Logan C (Level 20) | BU flip → clean → press → overhead → flip out. The ultimate combo. |
| **Over/Under flips** | Logan C (Level 19) | Alternating over-the-hand and under-the-hand flips, same hand. |
| **Side-to-side flips** | Logan C (Level 6) | Lateral flips alternating hands, and single-arm front/backhand. |
| **Redirect uppercut** | Agatsu | Around-the-body pass that redirects into an uppercut flip. |
| **Waiters clean / waiters snatch** | Cavemantraining | Clean/snatch with open palm (waiter grip). Similar to your "palm spin" but as a full lift. |
| **Open palm clean** | Steve Cotter, Cavemantraining | Same hand or cross-catch clean with open palm. |
| **Open palm snatch** | Cavemantraining | Palm-up snatch. |
| **Mug flip** | RAWFIT | Flip from a "mug" grip (like holding a mug). |
| **Oblique flip** | RAWFIT | Flip on a diagonal axis — between sagittal and transverse. |
| **Pendulum swing** | Cavemantraining | Lateral pendulum (side-to-side) as a launching position. |
| **Pass-through** | Cavemantraining | Passing the KB through the legs during a flip sequence. |
| **Flip catch pivot** | Agatsu | Catch a flip while pivoting the body. |
| **Under-body flip / dribble** | Logan C (Level 15) | Flip KB under your body like dribbling a basketball — related to your "leg flip" but with both feet on ground. |
| **High pull → bell snatch → flip out** | Logan C (Level 17) | High pull into a ball snatch, then flip out. |

### Probably implied but worth naming explicitly

| Move | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Swing flip & switch** | Cavemantraining flow staple — flip during a swing with immediate hand change |
| **Overhead throw & catch** | You have "overhead throw" (two hands) but not the one-hand variant common in Logan C's system |
| **Outside swing rear flip** | Logan C Level 13 — rear flip initiated from the outside swing path |
| **Ball side snatch** | Logan C Level 16 — snatch from the side catching by the ball |

### The biggest gaps in your system:
1. **Foundation drills** — swing release, tapping drills, H2H switches (you likely do these but haven't catalogued them)
2. **Bottoms-up family** — BU toss, BU clean → flip out, Tower of Terror, Tower of Power
3. **Ball clean/snatch family** — ball clean, ball snatch, ball side snatch, ball thruster launch
4. **Helicopter spin** as a distinct continuous move (vs. single sombrero flips)
5. **Forearm stall** and stall-to-flip transitions
6. **Oblique flip** (diagonal axis — between front and sombrero)
7. **Waiters clean/snatch** (open palm lifts)
8. **Under-body/dribble flip** (distinct from your "leg flip" — both feet stay on ground)
9. **Side-to-side flips** (lateral movement pattern)
10. **Over/under flips** (alternating over and under with same hand)
